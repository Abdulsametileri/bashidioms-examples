Normal $IFS and `read` operation:
$IFS before: $' \t\n'
IFS during: $' \t\n'	line = line1, w1 = wd1, w2 = wd2, w3 = wd3
IFS during: $' \t\n'	line = line2, w1 = wd1, w2 = wd2, w3 = wd3
IFS during: $' \t\n'	line = line3, w1 = wd1, w2 = wd2, w3 = wd3
IFS after:  $' \t\n'

Temporary $IFS change for `read` inline:
IFS before: $' \t\n'
IFS during: $' \t\n'	line = line1\ wd1\ wd2\ wd3, w1 = '', w2 = '', w3 = ''
IFS during: $' \t\n'	line = line2\ wd1\ wd2\ wd3, w1 = '', w2 = '', w3 = ''
IFS during: $' \t\n'	line = line3\ wd1\ wd2\ wd3, w1 = '', w2 = '', w3 = ''
IFS after:  $' \t\n'

Temporary $IFS change for `read` in a function:
IFS before: $' \t\n'
IFS during: ''	line = line1\ wd1\ wd2\ wd3, w1 = '', w2 = '', w3 = ''
IFS during: ''	line = line2\ wd1\ wd2\ wd3, w1 = '', w2 = '', w3 = ''
IFS during: ''	line = line3\ wd1\ wd2\ wd3, w1 = '', w2 = '', w3 = ''
IFS after:  $' \t\n'

But you may not need to change $IFS at all...  See `help read` and
note the parts about:
    ...leftover words assigned to the last NAME
    ...[read line until] DELIM is read, rather than newline
Normal $IFS and `read` operation using only 1 variable:
IFS before: $' \t\n'
IFS during: $' \t\n'	line = line1\ wd1\ wd2\ wd3
IFS during: $' \t\n'	line = line2\ wd1\ wd2\ wd3
IFS during: $' \t\n'	line = line3\ wd1\ wd2\ wd3
IFS after:  $' \t\n'
