### Running looks like this (`./embedded-docs.sh`):
Code, code, code...
Code, code, code...
More code, code, code...
More code, code, code...
Still more code, code, code...
Still more code, code, code...
End of code...


### Emitting (un-rendered) documentation looks like this (`./embedded-docs.sh --emit-docs`):
=== Docs for My Script

Docs can be Markdown, AsciiDoc, Textile, whatever.

We've wrapped them using the no-op ':' operator and a here-doc, but you
have to remember it's not bash that's processing the here-docs, so using
<<-DOC for indenting will not work.  Not quoting your marker will not allow
variable interpolation either, or rather, it will, but that won't affect your
documentation output.  So always quote your here-doc marker so your docs do
not interfere with your script (e.g., via the backticks we'll use below).

=head1 POD Example

If you use Perl POD (Plain Old Documentation), you can then use `perldoc`
and the various `pod2*` tools, like `pod2html` that handle that.  But you
can't indent if using POD or Perl won't see the markup, unless you
pre-process the indent away before feeding the POD tools.

And don't forget the `=cut` line!

Emitting Documentation
----------------------

This section uses a TAB indented here-doc, just because we can, but we
handle that in the Perl post processor, not via bash. :-/

You should add a "handler" to your argument processing/help options to emit
your docs.  If you use POD, use those tools, but make sure they are installed!
If you use some other markup, you have to extract it yourself somehow.

We know this is a bash book, but this Perl one-liner using regular
expressions and the range operator is really handy:
    perl -ne "s/^\t+//; print if m/DOCS'?\$/ .. m/^\s*'?DOCS'?\$/ and not m/DOCS'?$/;" $0

That will start printing lines when it matches the regular expression
m/DOCS'?$/, and stop printing when it matches m/^\s*'?DOCS'?\$/, except that
it won't print the actual line containing m/DOCS/ at all.

Add that to your argument processing as "emit documentation."

h2. Code at the end

Docs can just go *after* the end of the code.  There's an argument for putting
all the docs together in one place at the top or bottom of the script.  This
makes the bottom easy.  On the other hand, there's an argument for keeping
the docs _close_ to the relevant code, especially for functions.  So...
Your call.

But if this section only has an `exit 0` above it and is not wrapped in a
bogo-here-doc this might cause some syntax highlighters to be unhappy, and our
Perl doc emitter will miss it, so you have to find a different way to
display the docs.
